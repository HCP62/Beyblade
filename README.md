# BeyX Tester

## Overview
BeyX Tester is a program (soon to be Discord bot) that evaluates the competitive viability of Beyblade X combinations.

## Features
- Discord bot integration for easy access
- Simulates 10 matches per testing session
- Each match follows official WBO (World Beyblade Organization) ruling - first to 4 points
- Provides detailed win rate analysis:
  - Overall win rate
  - Win rates by finish type (spin, over, burst, extreme)

## How to Use
1. Join the Discord server where BeyX Tester is active (soon to be available)
2. Create a new testing session:
   - Use `/test` command in any channel
   - A private ticket channel will be created for your session
3. In your ticket channel:
   - Follow the bot's prompts to input match results
   - Use `/undo` to correct any mistakes
   - Use `/cancel` to end the session early
4. After 10 matches are completed:
   - View comprehensive statistics
   - Channel will auto-archive after 24 hours
   - Use `/save` to save results for future reference

## Commands
- `/test` - Start a new testing session
- `/undo` - Revert the last input
- `/cancel` - End the current session
- `/help` - View help information
- `/commands` - View available commands

## Planned Features
